    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  </header>
  <h2 id="what">What's all this then?</h2>
    <p>Well, you might be asking yourself, "What's a nerdy, athletic,
    bisexual drummerboy doing writing code instead of waiting
    tables?" <br>The answer should be obvious because <strong>fuck being a
    server!</strong></p>
  <h3 id="another">Here's another heading</h3>
    <p>Yeah, that's right. I'm making HTML5 my bitch rn.</p>
  <div class="list1">
    <h3>Here's an unordered list describing the advantages coding has over serving</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>No food</li>

      <li>Custom schedule</li>
      <li>$$$</li>

  <h2>For real tho</h2>
    <p>Does anybody really know what's going on?
     There's an orange mobster in the Rose Garden spouting dangerous nonsense
     about a very real disaster.<br>I've said it before, but if this was a
     disaster movie it would fail so hard because there's way too much stuff
     going on.</p>
  <h3>Here's an ordered list of real shit in 2020</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>TRUMP</li>
      <li>Australia on fire</li>
      <li>SARS-CoV-2</li>
      <li>Bernie supporters</li>
      <li>Joe Biden (but, blue no matter who, right?)</li>
      <li>Climate change (though the pandemic is helping, ironically)</li>
      <li>Plague of locusts (real)</li>
    </ol>
